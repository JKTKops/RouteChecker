# RouteChecker
This is a route checker for Breath of the Wild 100% Speedruns. Currently only verifies koroks.
May also check map meter, shrines, quests in the future.

### Usage
Requires having a text file containing the route. Download from google docs with file -> download as -> .txt

If your route is named "route.txt", simply run `routeChecker route.txt` in the same directory as the .exe file.

This is a windows binary. If you have Haskell installed, you can also run
`$ runHaskell routeChecker.hs route.txt` in the same folder as the source file.
